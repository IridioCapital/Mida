### Practice and backtest
Playground is a local broker created for paper trading and backtesting.
To use Playground first add the plugin to your dependencies.
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "@reiryoku/mida": "1.0.0",
        "@reiryoku/mida-playground": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

```javascript
const {
    Mida,
    MidaBroker,
} = require("@reiryoku/mida");

// Use the Mida Playground plugin.
Mida.use(require("@reiryoku/mida-playground"));

const myAccount = await MidaBroker.login("Playground", {
    id: "test", // The account id.
    localDate: new Date("2020-04-23"), // The broker local date.
    currency: "USD", // The account currency.
    balance: 10000, // The account initial balance.
    negativeBalanceProtection: true,
});

// Used to listen any market ticks.
myAccount.on("tick", (event) => {
    const tick = event.descriptor.tick;
    
    console.log(`New tick for ${tick.symbol} => ${tick.bid} | ${tick.ask}`);
});

// Used to elapse a given amount of time in the local date, this will trigger ticks.
await myAccount.elapseTime(60 * 10); // 60 seconds * 10 = 10 minutes.

console.log(myAccount.localDate); // The local date is now 2020-04-23 00:10:00.
```

#### Backtest expert advisors
If you have created an expert advisor, you can easily backtest it by just assigning
the playground broker to it.

```javascript
import { MyExpertAdvisor } from "./my-expert-advisor";

const myAdvisor = new MyExpertAdvisor({
    brokerAccount: myAccount,
});

await myAdvisor.start();
await myAccount.elapseTime(60 * 60 * 24); // Elapse 1 hour, this will trigger ticks and candles.

console.log(myAdvisor.orders); // The orders created by the EA in one hour.
```

## Disclaimer
Operating in CFDs/Forex is highly speculative and carries a high level of risk.
It's possible to lose all your capital. These products may not be suitable for everyone,
you should ensure that you understand the risks involved. Furthermore, Mida is not responsible
for commissions or other taxes applied to your operations, they depend on your broker,
and any technical inconvenience that may lead to money loss, for example a stop loss not being set.

## Why Mida and not MQL
Nowadays MQL is a procedural technology and a barrier between
modern traders and algorithmic trading. The mission of Mida is allowing
anyone to operate in financial markets without advanced programming skills or
specific computer requirements. Furthermore, Mida allows operating with MetaTrader
accounts without installing MetaTrader (which is available only for Windows OS).
