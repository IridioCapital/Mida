MidaFX is an open source trading engine designed to operate in assets markets like stocks, forex, crypto or commodities.
The term trading engine is introduced for the first time with this project to indicate not a simple sofware able to
create and close positions but an entire infrastructure and plugin system dedicated to the creation of expert advisors,
market analysis and investment backtesting.

In fact, through MidaFX you can:
- Real time operate in any supported market;
- Analyze markets and prices movements through dedicated analysis interfaces;
- Execute, test and automate investment and trading strategies by implementing custom expert advisors;
- Backtest and access time series covering the last decades.

## Supported Brokers
At this time the following brokers are supported through official and unofficial integrations.

- BDSwiss
