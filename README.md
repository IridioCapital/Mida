## Why Mida and not MQL
Nowadays MQL is an obsolete technology and a barrier between
modern traders and algorithmic trading. The mission of Mida is allowing
anyone to operate in financial markets without advanced programming skills or
specific computer requirements. Furthermore, Mida allows operating with MetaTrader
accounts without installing MetaTrader or using a VPS.
