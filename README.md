A JavaScript framework to easily operate in financial markets.

Mida is designed to:
- Trade financial assets such as stocks, crypto, forex or commodities;
- Operate with any MetaTrader broker account using only JavaScript/TypeScript;
- Automate and backtest trading strategies through expert advisors and indicators;
- Analyze markets and prices through indicators and analysis tools.

Furthermore, Mida is free and open source.

**This is a work in progress project, the API is not fully implemented, the NPM module is not published.<br>
Please create an issue for questions.**

## Usage
For the complete documentation please refer to the [API documentation]().<br>
Operating is possible with any MetaTrader 4/5 broker account and any directly supported broker.

### Broker account login
How to login into a MetaTrader 4 account.
```javascript
const myAccount = await MidaBroker.login("MT4", {
    id: "",
    password: "",
    serverName: "",
});
```

How to login into a directly supported broker and listen a margin call event.
```javascript
const myAccount = await MidaBroker.login("ICMarkets", {
    email: "",
    id: "",
    password: "",
});

myAccount.on("margin-call", (event) => {
    console.log("You could be in trouble...");
});
```

Playground is a local broker created for Mida, mainly to backtest strategies, expert advisors and ideas.
This is the perfect solution for practicing with a local demo broker account without registering to any broker.
```javascript
const myAccount = await MidaBroker.login("Playground", {
    localDate: new Date("2020-04-23"),
    currency: "USD",
    balance: 10000,
    negativeBalanceProtection: true,
});

myAccount.on("tick", (event) => {
    const tick = event.descriptor.tick;

    console.log(`A new tick for ${tick.symbol} => ${tick.bid} | ${tick.ask}`);
});

// Used to elapse a given amount of time in the local date, this will trigger ticks.
await myAccount.elapseTime(60 * 10); // 60 seconds * 10 = 10 minutes.
```

## Disclaimer
Operating in CFDs/Forex is highly speculative and carries a high level of risk.
It's possible to lose all your capital. These products may not be suitable for everyone,
you should ensure that you understand the risks involved. Furthermore, Mida is not responsible
for: commissions or other taxes applied to your operations, they depend on your broker;
and any technical inconvenience that may lead to money loss, for example a stop loss not being set.

## Why Mida and not MQL
Nowadays MQL is an obsolete technology and a barrier between
modern traders and algorithmic trading. The mission of Mida is allowing
anyone to operate in financial markets without advanced programming skills or
specific computer requirements. Furthermore, Mida allows operating with MetaTrader
account without installing MetaTrader (which is available only for Windows).
