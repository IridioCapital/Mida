Trend Confirmations:

when a Swing Point Break occurs

then confirmations are:
1. Swing Point Break with close > than support/resistance line or close > than previous swing point
2. Big Momentum in the direction of the Swing Point Break
3. Bollinger Bands break in the direction of the Swing Point Break
4. Trend of the timeframe is in the same direction of the swing point break
5. Trend of upper timeframes is in the same direction of the swing point break

Remember:
the longer the congestion/resistance/support the bigger the momentum of the break

if there is a downtrend, the lesser the congestion/resistance/support break the bigger the momentum of the generic trend
